                     I am a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at Harvard College interested in mechanical design and analysis. I have pursued coursework in mechanical systems, finite element analysis, and thermodynamics. I have project experience with engineering software including 3D CAD (SolidWorks), MATLAB, Abaqus FEA, and LabVIEW, as well as fabrication methods such as 3D printing, laser cutting, CNC milling, and lathe. Outside of engineering, I enjoy sculpture, fashion design, and upcycling. I am always eager to take on new challenges that integrate design and engineering!
